**ASSIGNMENT:**
This Tic Tac Toe game has a grid of 3x3, the playerIds are "X" and "O". At the moment, it doesn't validate the player turns, i.e. any player can take more than one turn at a time.


**JAVASCRIPT IMPLEMENTATION:**

The entire Tic Tac Toe game, including logic and UI, is implemented using JavaScript.

**SPRING BOOT BACKEND:**

Spring Boot hosts the JavaScript files for the game.
It serves static files, including HTML, CSS, Land JavaScript.

**INTEGRATION:**

JavaScript files are included within the Spring Boot project.
Spring Boot serves these files to the client's browser.

**RUNNING THE GAME:**

Users access the game through the Spring Boot application URL.
JavaScript handles all game interactions and UI updates in the client's browser.

**GAME CONDITIONS:**
The JavaScript game logic checks for win, lose, and draw conditions after each move.
Players win by getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
The game ends in a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.
Losing conditions can be added, such as if the opponent wins or if the player makes an invalid move.

**ADVANTAGES:**

**Simplified Development:** Entire game logic is in JavaScript, reducing complexity.
**Lightweight Solution:** Minimal server load since game logic runs in the client's browser.
**Easy Deployment:** Spring Boot hosts the game, requiring minimal setup.
